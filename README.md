# th155-decomp
This is a decompilation of all the Squirrel scripts from Touhou 15.5: Antinomy of Common Flowers by Twilight Frontier. The entire code of the game is a mix of C++ and Squirrel.

This was done with [NutCracker](https://github.com/darknesswind/NutCracker). As all this code was automatically generated, it's not very neat at the moment.
Improvements may be made in the future, but probably not until I write a script to compile the source files and check that they match the compiled scripts from the game.

The `unk_` files at the root of `src/` are files that were not in 135tk's file list. The hex digits after are derived from the hashing algorithm for file names in the archive.
If the name of these files is known, they should be renamed to their original name.

No copyright infringement on Twilight Frontier or any other party is intended. Under any reasonable request from a copyright owner, I will delete this repository.
